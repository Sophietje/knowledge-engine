# Knowledge Engine Documentation

Welcome to the documentation of the Knowledge Engine. The Knowledge Engine allows separate devices, applications and services to exchange information in an interoperable way. Interoperability is important because it improves the flexibility of the ecosystem as a whole. In an environment (like a Smart Home), where many of the parts of the ecosystem are typically developed and maintained by different (competitive) vendors, interoperability allows these different parts to understand each other. Also, when parts are replaced by similar ones from a different vendor, we want the system to be able to keep working. The flexibility that interoperability provides also aids the discovery and development of innovative ways for combining the knowledge that is already available in the ecosystem.

The Knowledge Engine provides this interoperability by using an ontology that describes the standardized terminology about the domain of the ecosystem. A deductive reasoner uses this ontology to match the demand an supply of knowledge within the ecosystem.
